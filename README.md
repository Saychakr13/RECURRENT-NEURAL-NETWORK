# LSTM
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning sequences of observations.

This makes them a network well suited to time series forecasting.

An issue with LSTMs is that they can easily overfit training data, reducing their predictive skill.

Dropout is a regularization method where input and recurrent connections to LSTM units are probabilistically excluded from activation and weight updates while training a network. This has the effect of reducing overfitting and improving model performance.
